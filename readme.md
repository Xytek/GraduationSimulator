# Graduation Simulator
Game project for IMT3601 - Game Programming

## For us - How to use what we've made
### Teacher with patrol script
For now this is very basic. There's a Patrol script on the teacher with an array that you can fill with empty game objects. He'll patrol through each of those checkpoints. If there's 3 checkpoints he'll go (start - 0 - 1 - 2 - 0 - 1...) so make sure that the teachers start position and the array element 0 is the same, and that the last element is close to the first one.
The triangle in front of the teacher will be the line of sight that I'll later add different trigger functionality on.
